		One of the main challenges in the aviation industry is to reduce maintenance costs and reduce downtime of machines by maintaining or improving safety standard. A large per cent of these costly delays are a result of unplanned maintenance such as when an aircraft has an abnormal behaviour on the previous flight, creating an operational disruption and even requiring an aircraft change.

		Since you don't know when failure will occur, you have to be conservative in your planning, especially if you're operating safety-critical equipment like engines. But by scheduling maintenance very early, you're wasting machine life or spare part life that is still usable, and this adds to costs to the owner.

		However, if you can predict when machine failure will occur, you can schedule maintenance right before it. By implementing predictive maintenance we can minimize unnecessarily scheduling maintenance and production hours lost during maintenance (improve the overall availability of equipment) and reduce the cost of spare parts and its consumables during the maintenance process.
